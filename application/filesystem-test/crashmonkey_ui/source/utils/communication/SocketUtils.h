 * Basic information about the layout of messages sent and received by
 * CrashMonkey:
 *
 * * all messages should be sent with network endian encoding
 * * all messages contain the type they are supposed to be:
 *     * one of the control messages
 *     * a checkpoint message
 * * all messages contain the size they are
 *     * more of a fail-safe than anything as it allows the socket to clear out
 *       any data that may have been sent in a message but that was not needed
 *         ex. sending a string along with a control message
 * * the data returned to callers depends on the type of a message

// socket connection. I'm lazy and using C++ so I'm using strings instead of a
// char* where I'd have to do some memory management myself. The fields at the
// end of this struct are not part of a union because C++ does not allow unions
// on types that have constructors (which string does). This is also not worth
// subclassing/using static_cast on for the different data types as there are
// only really two options right now. If it ever comes to the point where we
// need that sort of flexibility, we can go that route.
